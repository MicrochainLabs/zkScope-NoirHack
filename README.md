# zkScope-NoirHack


## Introduction 

A Noir library for the account abstraction ecosystem.

It enables a trust-minimized off-chain framework that secures and governs a smart account's on-chain behavior according to the user's preferences and intended actions.

At the hackathon, we're developing Noir circuits to secure and manage, and control the on-chain behavior of smart accounts.

## Organization
circuits, contracts, js
## Library
Contract and value whitelist

## Architecture
State into the Merkle tree

ZK circuits that read state and compute(Business logic an on-chain behavior)

Framework - zk-kit

## Integration
Safe account, smart session module, etc
## Use case
## Demo
